# 🚀 Streamlit Iris App 🚀

There are many ways to make web interfaces to allow interaction with Machine Learning models and we will cover two of them.

## Introduction

Now that you know how to build some Machine Learning models, it is the time to discover how to embeded it into a web app with a user-friendly interface. You have already saw, of course, some ML tools and you maybe played with it. If so, you know that it is much more interesting to interact with a ML model through a beautiful interface than using a notebook, especially when you are not an expert of this domain.  

In this project, we aim to help you to discover how to embed a ML model into a web app to interact with it much easier, by inputing the required information, making predictions and showing the result.


## Description

You will have a minimal interface demo with [Gradio](https://gradio.app/) & [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), this will just serve you to make sure that everything works correctly. Then, you will have to make your own interfaces, those allowing you to interact with a Machine Learning model, that is to say:
- Pass values through the interface;
- Recover these values in backend;
- Apply the necessary processing;
- Submit the previously processed values to the ML model to make the predictions;
- Process the predictions obtained and display them on the interface.


## Installation

You have two ways in order to setup and run this project.

### Setup

You need [`Python3`](https://www.python.org/) on your system to setup this app. Then you can clone this repo and being at the repo's `root :: streamlit-iris-app> ...`  follow the steps below:

- Windows:
        
        python -m venv venv; venv\Scripts\activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  

- Linux & MacOs:
        
        python3 -m venv venv; source venv/bin/activate; python -m pip install -q --upgrade pip; python -m pip install -qr requirements.txt  


**NB:** For MacOs users, please install `Xcode` if you have an issue.

- Run the demo apps (being at the repository root):

  Streamlit: 

      streamlit run src/app.py

  - Go to your browser at the following address :
        
      http://localhost:8501
